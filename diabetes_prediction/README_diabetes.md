# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.  
It uses a machine learning model trained on a standard diabetes dataset and provides a predictive system for new inputs.

---

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **visualizations**.
- Data preprocessing including **scaling** using `StandardScaler`.
- Machine Learning model trained using **scikit-learn**.
- Predictive system that takes **new patient input** and returns diabetes prediction.
- Model and scaler saved using **joblib** for reuse.

## Usage
1. Clone repo
2. Run `notebook.ipynb` or use the pickle files in `model/` to make predictions
